ðŸš€ Counter App

Welcome to the Counter App â€” a simple, interactive project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app allows users to increment, decrement, and reset a counter, with dynamic color changes based on the counter value.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

The Counter App is designed to:
- Display a counter value that starts at 0.
- Increase the count when the INCREASE button is clicked.
- Decrease the count when the DECREASE button is clicked.
- Reset the count to 0 when the RESET button is clicked.
- Change the counter's color based on its value:
  - Green for positive numbers
  - Red for negative numbers
  - Black for zero

ðŸ§  Learning Focus

This project primarily focuses on JavaScript and how it interacts with HTML and CSS. Key concepts explored include:

1. DOM Manipulation:
   - Selecting elements using getElementById()
   - Modifying text content dynamically
   - Updating CSS styles through JS

2. Event Handling:
   - Using onclick attributes for buttons
   - Executing functions based on user interactions

3. Type Conversion:
   - Converting strings to numbers with parseInt()
   - Ensuring correct data types when working with user input

4. Console Logging:
   - Debugging with console.log() to track counter updates

ðŸŒŸ Why This Project?

As I dive deeper into JavaScript, I wanted a hands-on project to reinforce core concepts. The Counter App is simple yet effective â€” offering real-time feedback, event handling, and DOM manipulation â€” all crucial skills for any aspiring developer.

ðŸ”§ How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open index.html in your browser.
3. Click the buttons and watch the counter respond!
